This data set represents claw morphometrics data for males in over 80 species of fiddler crab. Separate data files (TPS format) contain the major and minor claws of each species. Sample sizes range from 1 to 50. Each claw is represented by six landmark characters as well as an outline of the manux and pollex (the articulating dactyl was not included in outline captures). There is also an Excel file with information about each individual crab, including carapace width and whether the individual was left- or right-handed with respect to the major claw.
